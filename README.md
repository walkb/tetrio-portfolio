# tetrio-portfolio
Second iteration of portfolio website, this is a temporary repo until I'm ready to swap with current portfolio.

The goal is to emulate the looks of a game I enjoy playing every now and then: tetr.io

This repo will ideally swap with my current website (walkb.github.io) once I'm ready to swap them.
